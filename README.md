# AHK Tools

Small AutoHotkey v2 scripts I use for mouse chords, one-handed dictation, focus timers, and various small little quality of life improvements in Window utilities.

## Quick Start

- Install AutoHotkey v2.
- Run `[_MASTER_].ahk` to launch the set of scripts in this folder.
- Use `Ctrl+Alt+R` inside `[_MASTER_].ahk` to reload all child scripts.
